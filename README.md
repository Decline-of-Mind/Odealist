<h2>The Site's Mission</h2>
<p>So often people around me that seem battered down and lethargic when the state of our planet comes up. This is understandable but there is a lot to be optimistic about. Never before have so many people been engaged in the discussion and ideas about creating a better world. And that, to me, is the right way to look at this problem.</p>
<p>That is how Odealist was conceptualized. A General hub for all positive or inspiring news about individuals, special interest groups or countries that are willing to wage the good fight.</p>
<p>The target audience for this website is:<ul>
<li>Between the age of: 15-35</li>
<li>Mid-highly educated (altough not exclusively)</li>
<li>Interested in politics/industry/philosophy</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>When the user enters the site the intention is to greet him/her by a main page that doesn't overwhelm with buttons and/or information, yet doesn't feel empty. With few things coming at the user, yet having a good, peaceful image to not bore the user. </p>
